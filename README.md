## Fiber Video Installation Kits for Multi-Site Monitoring

**Comprehensive fiber kits to connect multiple sites or locations using fiber optics.**

- Includes fiber transceivers/converters, required patch-cords, connectors, and cable for full installation  
- Supports long-distance transmission via multimode or singlemode fiber ideal for linking cameras across campuses, facilities, or geographically separated sites  
- Provides interference-free, stable video and data transport over fiber — suitable for security, industrial, campus, or city-wide surveillance setups  
- Modular and scalable — deploy for single-channel or expand to multi-channel as your monitoring network grows  

Great for institutions, campuses, industrial sites, or multi-site enterprises needing centralized video monitoring over fiber.

## 8-Channel HD-CVI Video Installation Kit

**High-density, multi-camera video distribution over fiber for large surveillance deployments.**

- Supports transmission of up to **8 video channels** (HD-CVI / AHD / analog hybrid) over a single fiber link  
- Maintains video quality (720p / 1080p depending on camera) with uncompressed or digital-encoded video over fiber ensuring low latency and high fidelity  
- Reduces cabling complexity: multiple camera feeds can be consolidated onto one fiber, minimizing fiber runs and simplifying installation  
- Suitable for campuses, industrial facilities, city surveillance, multi-building security, or large-scale CCTV networks  

Ideal when you have many cameras feeding into a central monitoring or recording station, and want efficient fiber-based video transport.

## HD-CVI Video Kits for PTZ Camera Support

**Fiber-optic video kits that support both video and PTZ control data — perfect for remote or smart surveillance.**

- Video-over-fiber converters that support not just video but also control/data lines (e.g. RS-485 for PTZ) alongside analog/video feed over the same fiber path  
- Enables remote pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) control, data, and video transmission over long distances even up to kilometers when using singlemode fiber  
- Plug-and-play design with LED status indicators, no optical adjustments needed, simplifying deployment and maintenance  
- Compatible with mixed video standards (HD-CVI, AHD, CVBS, etc.) offers flexibility if your surveillance cameras are of different types  

Perfect for advanced security installations requiring remote control of cameras, such as perimeter monitoring, traffic surveillance, critical infrastructure, and large-scale CCTV systems.
